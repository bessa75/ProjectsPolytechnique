# Machine Learning Projects in 2024, Ecole Polytechnique (3A)
## Deep Reinforcement Learning : Training an efficient Snake agent (March 2024)
This project was the final assignment of Jesse Read's INF581 course *"Advanced Machine Learning and Autonomous Agents"*. The folder contains our final report and the notebook with the corresponding code. 

I want to thank Valentin Badea for his important contribution to the project, as well as my other groupmates Ethan Weitzmann and Vivien Brandt.

## Bayesian Uncertainty for age regression (March 2024)
This mini-project was a part of Kevin Scaman's MAP583 *"Deep Learning"* course, where we trained a Deep Learning model on age regression in order to estimate uncertainty on our predictions. We laid emphasis on the various methods to estimate uncertainty in vision tasks on a simple regression model.

The folder contains our notebook, as well as the corresponding PowerPoint presentation.

Our work was based on this article which was a survey of current computer vision methods for evaluating DL uncertainty : *"Evaluating Scalable Bayesian Deep Learning Methods for Robust Computer Vision"*, Fredrik K. Gustafsson, Martin Danelljan, Thomas B. Schön, IEEE 2020.

Many thanks to my groupmate Ivan Tchomba-Ngueko.

## Analyzing Fairness on the COMPAS case (January 2024)
This was a separate research project in my curriculum, where my group analyzed the state-of-the-art of fairness in AI in relation to the COMPAS/ProPublica case. We then trained a model using XGBoost that improved the COMPAS algorithm, providing similar accuracy and what we believed is a better tradeoff between the different fairness metrics. 

The folder contains our report and the corresponding notebooks, which are separated in for/against arguments to recreate the COMPAS/ProPublica case.

Many thanks to our supervisor Jean-Michel Loubes, and my fellow groupmates Antoine Martinez and Céleste Gallien.

## Clustering on Web Graphs : Hate Crime articles dataset (March 2023)
This project was part of the applied course INF473G "Mining, learning, and reasoning on Web Graphs" of Oana Balalau and Pierre Bourhis. We used a dataset of articles about hate crimes (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/johnybhiduri/us-crime-data) and carried out clustering methods to group articles referring to a same event. We leveraged methods from NLP and Graph Theory. We then used a random process to generate new hate crime article names based on our dataset.

The folder contains the report and the corresponding code. The modularity maximization is not coded here since it was done using Gephi.

Special thanks to our supervisors Oana Balalau and Pierre Bourhis, and my groupmate Auguste Crabeil.
