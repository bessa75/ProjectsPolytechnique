# Machine Learning Projects in 2024, Ecole Polytechnique (3A)
## Deep Reinforcement Learning : Training an efficient Snake agent (March 2024)
This project was the final assignment of Jesse Read's INF581 course *"Advanced Machine Learning and Autonomous Agents"*. The folder contains our final report and the notebook with the corresponding code. 

I want to thank Valentin Badea for his important contribution to the project, as well as my other groupmates Ethan Weitzmann and Vivien Brandt.

## Analyzing Fairness in the COMPAS case (January 2024)
This was a separate research project in my curriculum, where my group analyzed the state-of-the-art of fairness in AI in relation to the COMPAS/ProPublica case. We then provided an improved algorithm with XGBoost, providing similar accuracy and what we believed is a better tradeoff between the different fairness metrics. 

The folder contains our report and the corresponding notebooks, which are separated in for/against arguments to recreate the COMPAS/ProPublica case.

Many thanks to our supervisor Jean-Michel Loubes, and my fellow groupmates Antoine Martinez and Céleste Gallien.

## Bayesian Uncertainty for age regression (March 2024)
This mini-project was a part of Kevin Scaman's MAP583 *"Deep Learning"* course, where we trained a Deep Learning model on age regression in order to estimate uncertainty on our predictions. We laid emphasis on the various methods to estimate uncertainty in vision tasks, with a simple regression model which achieved decent accuracy.

The folder contains our notebook, as well as the corresponding PowerPoint presentation.

Our work was based on this article which was a survey of current computer vision methods for evaluating DL uncertainty : *"Evaluating Scalable Bayesian Deep Learning Methods for Robust Computer Vision"*, Fredrik K. Gustafsson, Martin Danelljan, Thomas B. Schön, IEEE 2020.

Many thanks to my groupmate Ivan Tchomba-Ngueko.
